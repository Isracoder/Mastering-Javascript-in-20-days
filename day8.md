# Day 8 🌤️ : 

## Summary of what I learned 📢:
  Today I started watching the third and final course on my list which is Deep Javascript Foundations v3. I learned about **primitive types , NAN and isNAN , and negative zero**.   
  &emsp;I've talked about types and primitve types before and using the typeof operator to check what type a value is in the first days of this learning sprint when watching the 
  first course. Something new to me is that NAN doesn't check whether or not a given value isn't a number , it checks whether or not it is a valid number. So coercing a string to a 
  number or doing some sort of operation on it will return NAN. NAN is also the only value that will not equal itself when comparing in js even when using the strict equality sign. Number.isNAN 
  was added to fix certain bugs for example passing a string to isNan will return true even though it should be false. Using Number.isNAN(value) gets rid of that issue.
