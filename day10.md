## Summary of what I learned 📢:
  Today I continued watching the third and final course on my list which is Deep Javascript Foundations v3. I learned about **static typing and scope.**  
  
  &emsp;Originally js is a dynamically or weakly typed language where you don't have to declare the type of variable when initially creating it. This differs from static or 
  strongly typed languages such as java or c++. In some cases this can result in errors and lead to confusion in the code when writing or reading it. To fix this problem solutions such as 
  typescript were created where the biggest benefit to using it is adding typing to js.  
  &emsp; Scope refers to the area or region of execution which determines accessability to variables.The compiler will first look in the current scope and if the variable being
  referenced isn't there it will keep going up one level until it reaches the global or top-level scope. If the variable is found in any one of these scopes the value in the closest scope is used. If it isn't found in the global scope or any other scope and 
  strict mode is set a reference error is throw. However if strict mode isn't set and the variable is being accessed as a target not as a source (i'm setting a value not retrieving it) then an auto-global variable is created. This however
  can also lead to certain errors which is why using strict mode is preferred.
